# Dart-Charge-API-Connecter
API Connecter for the Dart Charge (Dartford Crossing) API in VB.net DLL form

This is a connecter module for the Dartford Crossing - Dart Charge API. You can compile the DLL to use in your own application.
I created this a while ago and decided to release it in the case of it being any use to others.

An example application is included, under the folder Dart-Charge.

To configure the example, replace with your own details in file dcxapiExample.vb under line 12:         
dca = New DartfordCrossingAPI("_your_api_key_", "_your_account_number_")
